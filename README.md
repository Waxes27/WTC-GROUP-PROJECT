# CODING CLINIC BOOKING SYSTEM

The Coding Clinic Booking System has been designed as our WTC Group Project. The purpose behind this project is to provide users
at WeThinkCode with a system that they can run as a Command Line Argument within their Terminals to quickly and efficiently
book a "Coding Clinic" where users can volunteer or choose to participate in these events.

# INSTALLATION

To install the necessary files needed to run the CC Booking Sytem do the following:

  Google calendar API
  Run admin/setup.py
  then:
    Run main.py

# USAGE

Once the setup file has been run, you can go into any directory in your terminal and run the following command;
"clinic" which will bring up the Help menu with the list of commands you can use to carry out certain tasks. 
Additionally, you can run it with clinic (command name) to directly access one of those commands in order to make 
it easier to make or view or even cancel bookings as needed.
